todo:
- finish mods
- do something with country shorthand for entry? (these can be unintuitive, and i'd need to rope in databases)
- what should space do in mod mode? (currently: pause if timer running/move to next speaker if timer ended; should it
  always move to next speaker? maybe space is always pause and enter is always next speaker? that'd be work though)
- mod mode: colors? (currently none)

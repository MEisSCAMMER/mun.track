todo:
- fix the help dialog (hitting `h` then enter appears to automatically open the link to source code in the dialog)
- finish mods
- do something with country shorthand for entry?
- quorum sort of breaks at 100. is it necessary to fix? (probably not)
- caucus bug: entering 0:00 takes you into NegativeLandâ„¢ with times like -5:0-1. possible fix: just disallow 0:00
